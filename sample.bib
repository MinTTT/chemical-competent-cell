abstract = {Traditional protocols for preparing Escherichia coli for electroporation are laborious and often deliver highly variable transformation efficiencies. Many laboratories resort to purchasing expensive commercially prepared cells. This article describes a simple method for producing electrocompetent E. coli by centrifuging bacteria through a glycerol/mannitol density cushion. The method is rapid and replaces tedious multistep procedures with two 15-min centrifugations. Standard cloning strains consistently produce more than 8 × 109transformants/$\mu$g pUC18, whereas the strains TG1 and LE392 display efficiencies of more than 3 × 1010/$\mu$g DNA. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Tu2016,
abstract = {Bacterial competent cells are essential for cloning, construction of DNA libraries, and mutagenesis in every molecular biology laboratory. Among various transformation methods, electroporation is found to own the best transformation efficiency. Previous electroporation methods are based on washing and electroporating the bacterial cells in ice-cold condition that make them fragile and prone to death. Here we present simple temperature shift based methods that improve DNA transformation and recombineering efficiency in E. coli and several other gram-negative bacteria thereby economizing time and cost. Increased transformation efficiency of large DNA molecules is a significant advantage that might facilitate the cloning of large fragments from genomic DNA preparations and metagenomics samples.},
