## Recipe

### High performance chemical competent cell preparation



* Streak glycerol stocks in plate with appropriate antibiotics.
* Pick one to three colonies into LB medium with appropriate antibiotics.
* Overnight culture dilute 100 fold in 50ml SOB medium with appropriate antibiotics.
* Vigorously shaking before OD600 reach to about 0.6.
* Transform 50 ml medium into 50 ml centrifuge tube and stall it in ice for 10 min.
* 4 ℃, 2500 xg centrifuge 10 min.
* discard supernatant, re-suspend pellet by 15ml TB buffer and stall it in ice for 10 min.
* 4 ℃, 2500 xg centrifuge 10 min.
* discard supernatant and use 4 ml TB buffer re-suspend pellet, add 300 ul DMSO finally(final concentration：7% v/v).
* add 5 ml plasmid concentration into 100 ml fresh chemical competent cell.
* stall on ice for 30 min.
* 42 ℃ heat-shocked for 45s and coolon ice for 2 min.
* add 900ul SOC medium and shake culture vigorously.
* coat 100 ul medium on plate with appropriate antibiotics.
